# Path Finding #

UAlbertaBot implements a flood-fill based 'all shortest paths' path finding system to calculate ground distance to a given location on the map. This system can be found in `MapTools.getGroundDistance()`.

This system is currently used solely to find ground distance, while actual path finding is handled by the in-game path finding system. This is one of the areas of the bot that can definitely be improved!

#summary Design & Structure of the bot

= Design & Structure =

UAlbertaBot was designed to have an intuitive hierarchical structure based on proven military command systems. This structure is beneficial for several reasons:
  * Intuitive classes for ease of interpretation
    * ex: 'ProductionManager' handles every task related to production of buildingd and units
  * Modular design allows for easy modifications and updates over time
    * ex: To change unit micro behaviour simply replace the 'MicroManager' sub-classes
  * Vertical communication reduces code complexity
    * ex: Only CombatCommander can talk to Squad, passing it orders
  * Information is on a need-to-know basis, reducing data transfer between modules
    * ex: Only WorkerManager knows which workers are assigned to which jobs

  * Vertical structure avoids code duplication
 

Here is a rough outline for UAlbertaBot:

== [http://code.google.com/p/ualbertabot/source/browse/trunk/UAlbertaBot/Source/UAlbertaBotModule.cpp UAlbertaBotModule] ==

  * Main .dll module of UAlbertaBot
  * Inherits from AIModule 
  * Loads `Option`s and initializes `GameCommander`
  * `UAlbertaBot.onFrame()` directly calls `GameCommander.update()`

== [http://code.google.com/p/ualbertabot/source/browse/trunk/UAlbertaBot/Source/Options.cpp Options] ==

The Options namespace stores various parameters to be used throughout the code.

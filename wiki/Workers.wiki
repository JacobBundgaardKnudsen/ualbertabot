#summary How to modify Worker jobs and resource allocation

= Worker Jobs =

Workers in UAlbertaBot can have one of the following job assignments:

{{{
enum WorkerJob {Minerals, Gas, Build, Combat, Idle, Repair, Move, Scout, Default};
}}}

  * Minerals - Mine minerals from a given mineral patch
  * Gas - Gather gas from a given refinery
  * Build - Build a building
  * Combat - Help defend main base location
  * Idle - No current assignment
  * Repair - Repair a building
  * Move - Move to a building's construction location
  * Scout - Scouting the map
  * Default - Default constructor value

All worker jobs are stored in a `std::map` inside `WorkerData`. You can get the status of a worker by calling `WorkerData`'s `getWorkerJob()` or `setWorkerJob()` methods.

= Worker Assignment =

On each frame, `WorkerManager.update()` performs the following logic:

  * `WorkerManager.update()`
    * Re-allocate workers to new mineral patches if mined out
    * Send idle workers to gather minerals
    * Allocate gas workers until 3 in each refinery
    * Move build workers to building location if necessary

When a worker is trained, its status is initially set to `Default`.

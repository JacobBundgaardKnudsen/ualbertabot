#summary How to Download, Compile & Run the bot

= Prerequisites =

UAlbertaBot is currently being maintained using Visual Studio 2012. Any version of Visual Studio can be used to compile the source, however the only VS Project files I will be actively maintaining are in VS 2012.

List of Prerequisites for Bot:
  * [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads Visual Studio 2012] (any version, express works fine)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/ BWAPI 3.7.4] (or higher)
  * [http://www.boost.org/ BOOST 1.47.0] (or higher)

The UAlbertaBot project files use Windows Environment Variables to point to their required libraries.

List of Required Windows System Environment Variables:
  * BWAPI_DIR - BWAPI root directory
  * BOOST_DIR - BOOST root directory

= Download =

To download the bot source code, click [https://code.google.com/p/ualbertabot/source/checkout Source] above. Obtaining the source code requires an SVN client such as [http://tortoisesvn.net/ Tortoise SVN].

= Compile=

To compile the bot:
  # Open UAlbertaBot/vs2011/UAlbertaBot.sln in VS 2012
  # Select Release or Debug mode 
  # Ensure that the "Platform Toolset" for all projects is set to "v90"
  # Ensure [http://code.google.com/p/ualbertabot/source/browse/trunk/AdversarialSearch/source/Common.h#12 OPENGL_VIS] is not defined. This #define is used to launch our OpenGL visualization tool and is not supported at this time.
  # Build "AdversarialSearch" project
  # Build "StarcraftBuildOrderSearch" project
  # Build "UAlbertaBot" project

= Run =

To run the bot:
  # Install BWAPI tools and libraries
  # Run Chaoslauncher.exe (obtained from BWAPI project)
  # Modify Chaoslauncher config to point to compiled UAlbertaBot.dll
  # Run StarCraft using Chaoslauncher

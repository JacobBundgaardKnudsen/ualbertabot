#summary Information about the AdversarialSearch module

This folder contains the source code and VS project files for the implementation of our alpha-beta search algorithm for StarCraft combat micro decisions.

The details of the algorithms used can be found in our 2012 AIIDE paper: [http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=teRseTgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=teRseTgAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C Fast Heuristic Search for RTS Game Combat Scenarios].

As the search algorithm can only handle battles of sizes up to 8 vs. 8 units, it cannot be used in whole in its current form. Instead, it is used for its combat simulation system, which uses script-based micromanagement to play out StarCraft battles.

In UAlbertaBot, it is called by [https://code.google.com/p/ualbertabot/source/browse/trunk/UAlbertaBot/Source/Squad.cpp#179 Squad] to determine whether or not a Squad of units should retreat from a battle or continue to press onward. To implement your own retreat code, simply edit this section to remove all calls to CombatSimulation.

Here is a video of the search code in action, see youtube video for description:
